## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
If someone wanted to have the best chances of successful funding their Theater campaign, they would want to launch in May. December has a near 50/50 split of successful and failed campaigns. This may mean that people running the campaigns are not interested in spending their holidays running a crowdfunding campaign.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The funding goal appears to have a impact on the success rate. There appears to be a trough of success that bottoms out in the range of $25,000 to $29,999. I would concluded that donors are more willing to donate to plays that have a budget of $35,000 to $45,000. If the budget is lower, donors are less likely to support the play.


- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The dataset doesn't include any data on the users of Kickstarter. This may be helpfu in understanding the reasons why a person did or did not donate to a project. Other demographic information may help tell the store of what type of project a specific age, gener, metro area would support specific projects.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
I would be interested in investigating if the length of the campaign had any impact on the campaign outcomes. I would also be interested to see if more recent projects have a higher success rate. This may indicate that Kickstarter has become more trusted over the last couple of years.
